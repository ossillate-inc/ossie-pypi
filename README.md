# OSSIE <//>

Ossie is a bot that alerts you of malicious and other "risky" open-source packages/dependencies
in your software supply chain that exhibit suspicious code behavior or contain attributes that
make them vulnerable to attacks.

# Background

Ossie has been developed by cybersecurity researchers at [Ossillate Inc.](https://ossillate.com)
to assist developers when sourcing untrusted third-party open-source software dependencies.

# How it works

It collects package name/version info, queries the backend servers, and reports of any "risks"
or unwanted attributes found by Ossillate's vetting technology.
